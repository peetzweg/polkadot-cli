# polkadot-cli

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e64ae85: feat: auto-handle custom signed extensions and display encoded call hex

  - Auto-detect non-standard signed extensions from chain metadata and provide sensible defaults (void → empty bytes, Option → None, enum with Disabled variant → Disabled). This fixes `dot tx` on chains like people-preview that have extensions such as `VerifyMultiSignature` and `PeopleLiteAuth`.
  - Add `--ext <json>` flag to manually override or provide custom signed extension values for complex cases.
  - Display SCALE-encoded call data hex in both dry-run and submission output, useful for pasting into call decoders.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix `Vec<u8>` args (e.g. `System.remark`) to use `Binary` as polkadot-api expects
- Auto-wrap SS58 addresses into `MultiAddress.Id` for transfer calls

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b54658: Add account management and extrinsic submission

  - `dot account create|import|list|remove` — manage named accounts with BIP39 mnemonics or hex seeds
  - `dot tx Pallet.Call [...args] --from <name>` — build, sign, and submit extrinsics with metadata-aware arg parsing
  - `--dry-run` flag to estimate fees without submitting
  - Built-in dev accounts (Alice..Ferdie) always available for testnets
