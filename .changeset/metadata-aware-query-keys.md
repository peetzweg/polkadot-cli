"polkadot-cli": patch

Fix `dot query` for storage maps with composite keys (e.g. `Hrmp.HrmpChannels`). Positional CLI args are now composed into structs using metadata field names, so `dot query Hrmp.HrmpChannels 1000 5140` correctly passes `{ sender: 1000, recipient: 5140 }` instead of two separate arguments. Also adds metadata-aware parsing for NMap (multi-hasher) keys and descriptive error messages for wrong argument counts.
